contest beginning: 
	- Fast Typist (FT) writes the basic template and compile flags / scripts
	- Meanwhile, the other two contestants skin through the problem set in search of the easiest problem
	- Typist implements the easiest problem
general advice:
	- Discuss solutions with teammates
	- Write code on paper to save computer time
	- Take a break / change problems if you're stuck
	- When done with a problem, discard pieces of paper related to it
	- Monitor the scoreboard in search of easy problems
	- Print often (if possible)
contest endgame:
	- If not a lot of time is left, discuss one single problem as a team
	- In the last 30 - 40 minutes, submit anything that has any chance of working
