What to do:
	- Recall similar problems
	- Try to make the problem less specific
	- Make a bold claim and try to work around it
	- Try small inputs
	- Think with teammates
	- Pick a general method (listed below) or a data structure, and try to apply it
	- Print the answers for small cases and find a pattern
	- Make the problem formal and play around with pure math equations
	- Change the dimensions of the DP
	- Approach the problem from random angles

General techniques:
	- Binary search
	- Divide and conquer
	- Greedy
	- Dynamic programming
	- SQRT algorithms
	- Flows
	- Sprague Grundy
	- Inclusion-exclusion principle
	- Geometric interpretation
	- Count NON-VALID solutions
